  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>One day, long ago...</h2>
  <p> The story of our company begins with our CEO and founder, Mr. N. Bolts. Mr Bolts, recently flush with cash from a lawsuit settlement from a large hardware store investe
	literally all of his money into Gamestop stock and Bitcoin, selling both at the absolute best times and making enough to finally follow his dreams!</p>
  </p>Mr. Bolts, determined to never fail the working class DIYer had a dream that of opening a hardware store that was never out of stock of nuts or bolts, unlike
	 other larger stores. Investing his new found returns he made this store a reality and named it Nuts and Bolts, after himself.</p>
  <p>Today Nuts and Bolts is a thriving local hardware store that does its best to serve the local community and keeps nuts and bolts of all sizes in stock 94% of the time.
