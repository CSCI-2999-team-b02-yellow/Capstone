  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h4>One day, long ago...</h4>
  <p> The story of our company begins with our CEO and founder, Mr. Nutsand Bolts, returning home from his tour in Vietnam.
  What he wanted more than anything else was to finally do what he couldn't do in the army, get back to his hobby of DIY.</p>
  </p>As soon as he was home and unpacked he went straight to his nearest neighborhood hardware store to get all the tools he required, as his house 
  and possessions had burnt down while he was away. He was both enraged and depressed to find the hardware store only had a select few tools of what he needed.
  On his way out the door, he slipped on a stray bolt on the ground and hit his head against a metal rack, grievously wounding him.</p> However, as his skull cracked,
   he flashed with inspiration: I'll make my very own hardware store, one that will have anything and everything one might need! Thus, Mr. Bolts
    used the massive amount of lawsuit settlement money from the hardware store to open his very own store, bringing us to today.</p>
